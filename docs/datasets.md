- LJSpeech: Best for your very first run. It's high quality, 24 hours of one person. Use this to ensure your model can at least speak one voice clearly.

- LibriTTS: Essential for a MeloTTS clone. It contains thousands of speakers. Since you have an A100, you should eventually move to LibriTTS-R (the restored version) for the best results.

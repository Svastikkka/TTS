## 📚 **Recommended Libraries for Low-Latency Custom TTS**

### 1️⃣ **Language Detection (Optional but Recommended)**

* **`langdetect`** – simple, lightweight, fast.
* **`fastText`** – better for multilingual scenarios, supports 170+ languages, low overhead.

🔧 **Purpose:** Detect input language so you can choose the correct G2P model, normalization rules, and voice.

---

### 2️⃣ **Text Normalization**

* **`regex`** – build fast rule-based normalizers (numbers, dates, currencies).
* **`inflect`** – convert numbers → words in English.
* **`Babel`** – handle locale-specific formatting for dates/times/currencies.

🔧 **Purpose:** Ensures your acoustic model sees clean, normalized text (e.g., “2025” → “two thousand twenty-five”).
💡 You can also build a **small transformer-based normalizer**, then convert it to TensorRT (if you want ML-driven normalization).

---

### 3️⃣ **Phoneme Generation (G2P)**

* **[`phonemizer`](https://github.com/bootphon/phonemizer)** – supports multiple languages and IPA phoneme output.
* Or train your own G2P model per language (convertible to ONNX → TensorRT for fast inference).

🔧 **Purpose:** Produces phoneme sequences that your acoustic model can consume (avoids spelling-based pronunciation issues).

---

### 4️⃣ **Deep Learning Model Runtime**

* **PyTorch** (for training / exporting models)
* **ONNX Runtime** (to export from PyTorch → ONNX)
* **TensorRT** (for final optimized inference)

🔧 **Purpose:**

* Train / fine-tune models in PyTorch.
* Convert to ONNX for portability.
* Optimize and deploy with TensorRT to hit <200 ms latency.

---

### 5️⃣ **TTS Models**

Choose an **acoustic model + vocoder** combo that is TensorRT-friendly:

* **FastSpeech 2** (fast, non-autoregressive → lower latency)
* **VITS** (end-to-end, high quality, can be converted to TensorRT)
* **HiFi-GAN** (vocoder, fast inference)

> 🔧 You can export these from PyTorch to ONNX, then optimize with TensorRT’s `trtexec`.

---

### 6️⃣ **Audio Handling**

* **`soundfile`** or **`torchaudio`** – save audio output (WAV/MP3).
* **Streaming support** – if serving real-time, consider gRPC/WebSocket for streaming audio chunks.

---

## 🏗️ **Your Final TTS Stack**

```
LLM → [langdetect/fastText] → [regex + inflect + Babel] → [phonemizer] 
→ [FastSpeech2 (TensorRT)] → [HiFi-GAN (TensorRT)] → [soundfile/stream]
```

This architecture will give you:
✅ **<200 ms latency** (with TensorRT-optimized models on a decent GPU)
✅ **Multilingual support** (switch per language)
✅ **Scalable pipeline** (easily add new voices/languages)

---

## ⚡ Key Notes for Low Latency

* **Prefer non-autoregressive models** (FastSpeech2 is faster than Tacotron2).
* **Batch size = 1** for real-time inference.
* Use **FP16 precision** in TensorRT for speedup (if your GPU supports it).
* Profile your pipeline — sometimes text normalization can be the hidden bottleneck.
